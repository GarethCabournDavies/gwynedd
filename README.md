Gravitational Wave sYNthesised Example Detector Data (GWYNEDD) is a suite for creating realistic example detector data

This suite is largely based on the [PyCBC](www.pycbc.org) fake data creation, but with additional features in order to create data which uses non-stationary noise and to add glitches.
